                                Established in 2014 by two digital marketeers, eStore Factory has grown to be a team of 62 professionals located at our three offices across Ahmedabad, India, who take pride in identifying themselves as Amazon specialists. When hiring our team members, we look for their ability to get intrinsically involved in a client’s account & enjoy the process of making an Amazon seller profitable. Aspiring to be a Center of Excellence for Amazon services, we encourage our associates to see themselves as ecommerce consultants. We reward skills acquisition and ecommerce expertise through programs such as Saturday School (peer-to-peeranet porta where they played a part in the achievement).
